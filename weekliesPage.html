    <br> <p><b>This week</b> it was our last full week of class which is wild to think about. Life truly moves at an accelerated pace with
        each passing year. This week we finished working on updating our portfolio websites and I implemented several new aspects to my website
        such as using Java to move one of the Windows icons as well as adding an unfinished projects page. We also had two discussions on the past Friday
        which I found informative and interesting. This class really helped myself grow an appreciation for coding as HTML and CSS (and Java as well) have
        so many creative uses. I also really enjoyed the way we learned the coding concepts in this class as I appreciated learning the why and how behind
        certain techniques. I look forward to continuing to grow my knowledge within internet art and am excited to see where my current set of creative
        coding knowledge takes me.
    <br>
    <br>
    <p> <b>Outside of this class</b>, I end classes on Tuesday. This year as mentioned earlier went by super fast as I only have one semester left here at
        Ohio State. I am studying for my physiology exam as well as finishing a website for another course of mine (ACCAD 5140). For that class we had to make our
        website responsive which I tried to implement on my webpage for this class (it did not work on all components for this website). I am planning on going home
        a week from tomorrow, but home for me is only 20 minutes away so I can throw a stone from my place on campus and it would reach my house LOL. I am excited though
        to relax and enjoy my time on campus without having to study, etc. As I am writing this, I am eagerly anticipating the release of the College Football
        Playoff schedule. I personally believe Texas should be in over Alabama but we shall see what the committee decides.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
        I am looking forward to another (short) week ahead and wishing the happiest and healthiest holiday season! Thank you for all your help and assistance
        throughout this semester, I truly appreciate it!

            <br> <p><b>This week</b> we worked on j5 work and finished our drawing with code project. I enjoyed this work
                greatly as it was pretty quick to catch onto how to implement simple strings in code to create more interactive
                elements that HTML and CSS were previously not capable of. My project I presented I was proud of, but I would have
                liked to make a more cohesive project. I think once we start implementing this java code within our previously
                created websites. For my website, I had a Y2k/vintage Microsoft design. I think implementing j5 within this design
                would work perfectly as interactive animations and simple motion movements seem to be a pinnacle of Y2k design. This upcoming
                week I am looking forward to fine tuning my j5 skills as well as preparing for the final presentation.
            <br>

            <p> <b>Outside of this class</b>, I am looking forward to preparing for Thanksgiving break. Thankfully I am basically
                finished selling shirts for my club. While it was long and seemingly never-ending, I did enjoy getting to talk with
                all the different members during the tabling times. I am excited to head home for the holiday which is roughly only 20 minutes north LOL!
                Thanksgiving food includes some of my favorite side dishes. I must say, I think like most people say the turkey is overrated. However, I must add
                that most of the pies are overrated! A good pie is a decent dessert, but if a pie is done wrong, then it surely creates a horrid dessert. I am hoping
                to finish my last applications for grad school before December 1st. I also want to start studying for my final exams and curating any final projects so
                there is not a ton of work last minute.

            <br> <p><b>This week</b> we finished presenting our projects that we worked on over the past few weeks. We also began
                to learn how to draw with code. I found this super interesting because it is so cool to be able to see simple lines
                of code create complex shapes. Learning java this way has been very helpful and useful. I originally was a 
                Computer & Information Science major (before switching majors) and took a few java courses. I dropped because I did
                not find it enjoyable as it was mostly backend work. Recursion also was a major topic that confused me always. This method
                of teaching and interactive learning interests me greatly as I am able to see the results of the code! I installed all of the 
                necessary components for the j5 to work properly so I hope I'm able to keep all the files properly organized.

            <p> <b>Outside of this class</b>, my A/C broke in my apartment. Normally this isn't a big deal in the winter but I am a person
                that loves to keep the fan on and keep the apartment cool during all times of the year. I put in a service request to fix it
                and I am hoping it is solved swiftly. This actually happened once before in the summer and they had to bring a mobile air conditioner into 
                my unit. It was a hot mess express. Schoolwork has been picking up over these last few weeks. I have an exam on
                Tuesday for physiology. I unfortunately have to table for one of my clubs every single day next week and sell shirts for the 
                Michigan game. It is entering the final weeks of the semester which always makes me relieved but also sad as time seems to be moving
                faster every year.

                    everyone's project, I got to work on my website. I was able to begin to build the structure of the portfolio
                    website. I did change my idea slightly by implementing a sidebar as well as a navigation bar. The sidebar was much
                    more difficult than I anticipated, but I was able to work through it by researching online and using great resources
                    like W3schools as well as good old trial and error implementing styles of code, etc. I was able to find the perfect font family
                    after my previous selection did not work out according to plan. However, despite the challenges, I feel like the website is coming
                    along well! I'm excited to see where it continues to go this week!

                    my upcoming physiology exam which is on Wednesday. By the next weekly the exam will thankfully be over and hopefully all went well. I have also
                    been working on graduate applications which I hope to turn in within the next two/three weeks. I have been able to keep up with current television as 
                    I have been watching <i>SNL</i>, NFL games, and also <i>The Real Housewives of Salt Lake City</i>. Besides studying/schoolwork today, I plan to do a deep clean of my

                    as the possibilities are truly endless for what CSS and some javascript is able to accomplish in making
                    a dynamic and interactive webpage. As I begin thinking of ideas and how I want my website to look like,
                    I would prefer my webpage to be very clean and have a modern freshness. In class this week, we learned all 
                    about more CSS techniques and skills to implement into our webpage, while also going further with 
                    modifications. On Friday, we had a discussion about online identities. This is such a interesting topic
                    as an online identity has truly transformed throughout recent years in what it encompasses and how it is
                    able to connect communities and people together.

                    everything up to fate. I have been hard at work selling t-shirts that I designed for my club, Student-Alumni
                    Council. Every day this week I have spent a few hours in the union tabling and getting the word out about these
                    tees. We sold a decent amount, but in all honesty did underperform so we are going to readjust our strategy for the
                    next shirt, which is coming up in a mere two weeks. I have also been feeling under the weather this past week which
                    is not common for me (and hence why I was virtual most days!) I am feeling better but still am planning on taking it
                    easy this weekend. I went home to visit my relatives who are visiting. I am looking forward to fall break as I will
                    be heading to Chicago with family. I always enjoy Chicago and it is one of my favorite places.

                    week reviewing any quick CSS concepts and then getting time to work on our poem projects.
                    I greatly enjoyed reviewing everyone's projects on Wednesday and Friday. I saw several
                    unique tools that I certainly want to implement in future projects. Some of these tools that
                    intrigued me were the changing of the highlight color, the implementation of gifs, and overall
                    any tool that makes a webpage more interactive. On Friday we had a discussion of interfaces
                    which I had the pleasure to be apart of and contribute to. One of the articles that I presented on was,
                    <i>"What Screens Want"</i> by Frank Chimero. It was interesting reading the article and seeing the rapid and
                    ever-evolving realm of interfaces. Specifically, the iOS interface changes were so intriguing to me as I
                    feel as if I have experienced the different eras of iOS interface. LOL.

                    and piecing together random required materials. On my grocery list this week, I have found
                    out the dynamic use of swiss cheese. It has truly become such a favorite of mine in the past few days.
                    This weekend I am heading to South Bend, Indiana to go to the Ohio State vs. Notre Dame game. I am
                    excited to see the campus of Notre Dame as I have heard many good things about it. I love getting
                    to experience a glimpse of different campuses. I have had a ton of laundry that I am
                    finally caught up with so I feel relieved in that regard.

                    more about CSS techniques, including proper linking format. I was able to create the

                    how much and how many styles are available within CSS. I have begun working on and

                    and received all <i>100+ shirts</i> to sell in the coming weeks. I also had a really good gyro this past week.

                <u>Weekly 2</u>
            <br> <p><i>This week </i> we learned a lot of new concepts within class. We started coding in CSS which is different from 
            HTML but similar in many regards. I find CSS to be mostly easy to comprehend, but I think the linking
            of the files of HTML and CSS could cause some problems along the way. In this class we are using Visual Studio
            Code but in the other HTML class I am in we are using Adobe Dreamwaver (and also using Bootstrap components). It is interesting
            to see the similarities and slight differences that exist between the two softwares. 
            Dreamwaver is not as easy to see the live results of the HTML as it is in Visual Studio Code. 
            I find the possibilities that CSS affords to be so intriguing as there are so many different options and possibilities.</p>

            <p> Outside of <b>this</b> class, I had my first exam in Physiology this past week which hopefully went well. It was on a Scantron 
                and in paper which was a first for me in my four years of college. My other classes have been going well and I feel like I am
                settling into my semester routine which I always enjoy after the hectic first few weeks. It is nice to be able to find the
                perfect times to go to the gym, grocery store, and social activities. I have begun watching The Comeback as well as keeping
                up with current reality shows and college football. NFL begins this weekend and after the shocking defeat of Kansas City on Thursday,
                truly anything is possible. </p>

                I am looking forward to the week ahead and excited for another week of learning!

            <p>This was the first full week of class and I was able to learn a lot of new coding concepts in HTML. 
            Typically in classes previously, I did not enjoy the concept of Java and coding so I was slightly nervous
            entering another coding class after being removed from the coding world for several semesters. 
            I was able to grasp the concepts and I actually really enjoy seeing the front-end work of HTML compared to 
            the back-end work of Java where I rarely saw the payoff of the code besides a math problem being computed. 
            I am also taking another HTML class through ACCAD this semester so it has been intriguing to get a lot of 
            hands-on experience with HTML. I also put this code into an HTML file to begin practicing how to continue doing this weekly. 
            I greatly enjoy learning about the unique coding aspects of HTML. I have also begun dabbling slightly into CSS.</p>

            <p>This semester in general has been exciting as I enter my fourth and final year at OSU. The heat has been 
            horrendous though which has thrown a wrench into my class/work routine due to just the extreme sweat/temperatures.
            My other classes are interesting as well but one class is five days a week which has been truly humbling as 
            it feels like a return to a high school schedule where class is everyday! The workload is slowly picking
            up but I am also trying to stay proactive and remain on top of things so I do not have to study for 
            multiple things all at once. After four years, I am hoping I have the studying aspect down to a science/routine!</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            I am looking forward to a great semester and continuing to strengthen/grow my HTML skills.
